# Weather24H
> Android weather :sunny: :umbrella: :cloud: app powered by OpenWeatherMap.org

To build this project add resource file `app/src/main/res/values/keys.xml` with such content
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="owm_org_api_key">my_api_key_here</string>
</resources>
```
Also replace `my_api_key_here` with your own api key on [this site](https://openweathermap.org)

Enjoy! :sun_with_face:
